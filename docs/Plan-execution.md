# Plan Execution: Phase 1 â€“ Persistence & Deletion Confirm Modals

This document summarizes the implementation and outcomes of Phase 1 (Persistence) from the project implementation plan. It covers the data persistence logic, UI/UX for loading state, and the confirm modals for deletion of folders and images.

---

## 1. Persistence

### 1.1. Data Model & Store Updates

- The MobX store was refactored to support serialization and deserialization of folders and images.
- Data schemas for folders (with support for future parent/child relationships) and images were defined.

### 1.2. Persistence Logic

- The app now saves all folders and images to `localStorage` on every change.
- On startup, the app loads folders and images from `localStorage` if available, restoring the previous state.
- The persistence logic is encapsulated in the MobX store, with methods for `serialize`, `deserialize`, `saveToStorage`, and `loadFromStorage`.

### 1.3. UI/UX for Persistence

- A loading indicator is shown while the app hydrates state from storage on startup, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### 1.4. Deletion Confirm Modals & Related UI

- **Folder Deletion:**
  - When a user attempts to delete a folder, a confirm modal appears with the following:
    - **Title:** "Delete folder?"
    - **Message:** "Deleting a folder will also delete all subfolders and images in them. This action can not be undone."
    - **Actions:**
      - "Cancel" (closes the modal, no deletion)
      - "Delete folder" (confirms deletion, removes the folder and all its contents)
- **Image Deletion:**
  - A "Delete selected" button is available in the images list when images are selected.
  - Clicking this button opens a confirm modal with:
    - **Title:** "Delete selected images?"
    - **Message:** "This will permanently delete the selected images. This action can not be undone."
    - **Actions:**
      - "Cancel" (closes the modal, no deletion)
      - "Delete images" (confirms deletion, removes all selected images)

### 1.5. Testing

- Robust unit tests were added for both confirm modals:
  - Tests ensure the modals appear, the correct actions are triggered, and only confirmed deletions are executed.
  - Tests use dialog-scoped queries to reliably interact with the correct buttons.
- All tests pass, confirming correct behavior.

## Summary

- The app now reliably persists all folders and images between sessions.
- Users are protected from accidental data loss by clear, accessible confirm modals for destructive actions.
- The implementation is robustly tested and ready for further feature development.
